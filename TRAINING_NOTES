# Remember that coco_carla.yaml can be modified to target either the adapt or baseline versions
# For Carla Adapt
python train.py --weights yolov5s.pt --data data/coco_carla.yaml --device 1 --noval  -epochs 15

# For Carla Baseline
python train.py --weights yolov5s.pt --data data/coco_carla.yaml --device 1 --noval --epochs 15

# For Soartech Adapt
python train.py --weights soartechDetectorV2.pt --data data/soartech.yaml --device 1 --imgsz 640 --noval  --epochs 15

# For Soartech Baseline
python train.py --weights soartechDetectorV2.pt --data data/soartech.yaml --device 1 --imgsz 640 --noval  --epochs 15

# Still have to:
#  X Push domain adapt to github
#  X Add all of 'DistributedCE/detection' to gdrive to be used at home
# 
#  X Push CE results and AE results to the hard drive
#  X Then run experiments for carla AT THE LAB
#  X THEN TAKE THE HARD DRIVE WITH YOU

# At home:
#   X Create baseline and adapt for soartech
#   X Generate datasets and YAML for soartech
#   X Retrain soartech model on datasets   (MAY HAVE TO CHANGE INPUT SIZE)
#   X Do some image tests (you can just do a vidcap and read from a particular frame)
#   X Run soartech experiments


#  What you still have to run:
#    - email everyone
#    - carla experiments with pre2 (be sure to ignore the correct folders)
#    - soartech experiments for ce1 with baseline

# On the paper:
#    - When doing the baseline-adapt comparison, you should probably just do 1 fig per ce, and try to fit multiple on a line
#    - Still have to think about how to present the 'annotation burden'. Maybe avg total time per CE for baseline vs adapt
#             number of necessary annotations (e.g. how many labelled in the end) for baseline vs. adapt, and 
#              maybe a short blurb on distribution of annotation for adapt (e.g. how much time on review, how much on annotation)
