# Remember that coco_carla.yaml can be modified to target either the adapt or baseline versions
# For Carla Adapt
python train.py --weights yolov5s.pt --data data/coco_carla.yaml --device 1 --noval  -epochs 15

# For Carla Baseline
python train.py --weights yolov5s.pt --data data/coco_carla.yaml --device 1 --noval --epochs 15


# Still have to:
#  - Alter client.py to have multiple ae result folders
#     and run_experiment should also notify client.py
#      when it needs to switch models
#  - Push domain adapt to github
#  - Add all of 'DistributedCE/detection' to gdrive to be used at home
# 
# Push CE results and AE results to the hard drive
# Then run experiments for carla AT THE LAB
# THEN TAKE THE HARD DRIVE WITH YOU

# At home:
#  Create baseline and adapt for soartech
#  Generate datasets and YAML for soartech
#  Retrain soartech model on datasets   (MAY HAVE TO CHANGE INPUT SIZE)
#  Do some image tests (you can just do a vidcap and read from a particular frame)
#  Run soartech experiments
#
